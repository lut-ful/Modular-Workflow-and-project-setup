# Modular-Workflow-and-project-setup

# Problem Statement:

## Business Context:
- The project aims to develop a machine learning system that predicts individual income levels based on demographics and employment data.
- The Prediction boundary is set at $50,000 annually (binary classification problem).
- The solution will help in understanding socio-economic factors affecting income levels.
- Enable data-driven decision making for policy makerss and financial instituations.
- Identify key socio-economic factors influencing income disparities.
- Support targete intervations programs for economic develoment

## Key Stakeholder
- **Policy Makers:** For evidence-based policy development
- **Financial Institutions:** For risk assessment and product development
- **Social Services:** For resource allocation and program planning
- **Research Organization:** For socio-economic studies

# Dataset Details:
Let's visualize the data structures and feature:
